In the case of inland waterway vessels the reliable method of predicting these coefficients in early design stage is missing. Based on the outcomes from model tests and from numerical computations the present authors show that it is difficult to determine uniquely the trends in change of wake fraction and thrust deduction factor resulting from the changes of hull form or operating conditions.
               Nowadays the resistance and propulsion model tests of inland waterway vessels are carried out rarely because of relatively high costs. On the other hand, the degree of development of computational methods enables? to estimate the reliable values o interaction coefficients. The computations referred to in the present paper were carried out using the authors? own software HPSDKS and the commercial software Ansys Fluent.},

  abstract    = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
                 of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
                 moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
                 efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
                 of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
                 data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
                 objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
                 hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
                 tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
                 discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
                 algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
                 to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
                 Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
                 favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
                 a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},
